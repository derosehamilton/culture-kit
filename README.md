# culture-kit

This project is a prototype of a ‘kit for cultural history’ inspired by the Maker Lab projects created at the University of Victoria. The project is a reconstruction of a phonograph built using LittleBits hardware. LittleBits are easy-to-use electronic building blocks which are simply snapped together so that just about anyone can create electrical prototypes and inventions without needing any knowledge of complex technologies.

Originally, we set out to construct a unique entertainment experience as we wanted to combine a phonograph with a homemade Red Raven Magic Mirror. Unfortunately, given the time constraints of our project and the complexities in designing a sixteen-sided mirror, we had to abandon the idea of incorporating a Magic Mirror.
