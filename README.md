# The Phonograph Kit

This project is a prototype of a ‘kit for cultural history’ inspired by the Maker Lab projects created at the University of Victoria. The project is a reconstruction of a phonograph built using LittleBits hardware. LittleBits are easy-to-use electronic building blocks which are simply snapped together to create electrical prototypes and inventions.

Originally our project was meant to incorporate LittleBits to recreate the mid 1950's children's toy "The Red Raven Magic Mirror," a variant of the praxinoscope. A 16-sided mirror sits onto of a record player and reflects the images on the inside label of the record creating an animated image along with music. Unfortunately, given the time constraints of our project and the complexities in designing a sixteen-sided mirror, we had to abandon the idea of incorporating a Magic Mirror. In the end, we decided to construct a kit which allowed users to rebuild a phonograph using modern day techonolgy. This kit was ultimately comprised of several pieces of foam board, velcro hook and loop fasteners, a styrofoam block, a plastic cup, a vinyl record, a sewing needle and a paper cone. In addition, the LittleBits power adapter, motor, motorMate, wire, and dimmer switch were also included in the kit.
